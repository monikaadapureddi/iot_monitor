Internet of Things (IoT) is a type of network technology, which senses the information from different sensors and makes anything to join the Internet to exchange information. This will be done employing a higher communication device like a Wi-Fi module. The data processed by the sensors is converted to meaningful data and relayed to the user. The user can view the data with the help of a handheld device such as a mobile phone or a tablet. This project helps the farmers to irrigate the farmland in an efficient manner with automated irrigation system based on soil moisture.
